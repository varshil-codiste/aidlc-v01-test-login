# AI-DLC — Skills Catalog

This folder contains **Agent Skills** (Anthropic-standard `SKILL.md` packages) that give the the pod on-demand expertise at each stage of the AI-DLC workflow. Skills run alongside the rule files in `../aidlc-rule-details/` and compose with them via description-match triggering and progressive disclosure (lightweight metadata at boot, body on trigger, resources on demand).

The skills here work across **Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cline, Windsurf, OpenCode, Aider, Kilo Code, Augment, Antigravity, OpenClaw, and Hermes** — see `skill-policy.md` § Per-Agent Notes for any per-agent quirks.

## How to install / use

From the project root after cloning:

```bash
bash .aidlc/skills/scripts/install-aidlc-skills.sh
```

The script creates symlink shims so each IDE finds skills in its expected location (`.claude/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, `.github/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`) — single source of truth at `.aidlc/skills/`. It also runs `lint-skills.py` to catch frontmatter issues that would cause silent failures in some IDEs.

For IDE-specific notes (Cursor reload, GitHub Copilot config, etc.) see `skill-policy.md`.

## How to author a new skill

See `AUTHORING.md`. In short:

1. Pick a need that recurs across projects
2. Vendor (or git-submodule) any upstream skill that already addresses it
3. Author a AI-DLC wrapper `SKILL.md` (frontmatter `name` + `description` are mandatory)
4. Add 5 trigger-test prompts and run them through the eval harness
5. Run `lint-skills.py` locally
6. Open a PR; pod reviews; merge

---

## Governance

- **Free-roam invocation, audit-logged**: any skill may be invoked at any stage. Every invocation appends an entry to `aidlc-docs/audit.md` with timestamp, skill, stage, Tier, inputs summary, outcome.
- **Sensitive skills require a per-action signoff** before live mutation (production deploy, IaC apply, payments, secrets rotation). The countersign extends the existing 5-gate model — no new gate is introduced. See `skill-policy.md` § Sensitive Skills.
